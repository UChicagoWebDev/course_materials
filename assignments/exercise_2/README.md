# Exercise #2: Landing Page

10 points

**DUE: Friday, April 5 by 5:00pm**

### Instructions

One of the most common web development tasks is to build a **Landing Page**, the
first thing visitors will see when visiting a web address. Developers and
designers have built up a fairly common set of elements that you'll see used
again and again and that give us a good opportunity to put our new CSS skills
to work.

First, let's look at some well-designed landing pages: [airbnb.com](airbnb.com);
[shopify.com](shopify.com); [notion.so](notion.so). And of course
[uchicago.edu](uchicago.edu). Look at them on your laptop browser and with your
phone.

Now, make your own landing page for an imaginary product, company, or
institution. Your page should, at a minimum, contain the following elements:
1. A navigation bar across the top
1. A large, visually appealing hero element with a clear "call to action"
  button or link.
1. At least three sections with multi-column desktop layouts, for example:
  - Pricing tiers
  - User testimonials
  - Stories or case studies
  - Sample listings
  - Popular or trending
  These sections should vary the number and spacing of columns. Use one
  column-count, one flexbox, and one css grid.
1. A footer element with links

Make your page display reasonably on mobile devices. Note that you are allowed
to collapse or drop some elements in the mobile view.

Use at least two fonts other than the system default. You do not need to include
any animation or other interactive elements, but are welcome to.

Clone this repositoriy, and edit `index.html` and `styles/landing.css`.
Put all your styling into `landing.css` instead of putting your CSS directly
in a `<style>` element or as a `style` attribute. You only need to make the
landing page. There's no need to make a second `html` file, and all your links
can have `href="#"`.

Remember to include in your submission any classmates you collaborated with and
any materials you consulted. Because these pages are for imaginary organizations
you have each made up, *we expect them to be fairly different from one another.*

### Grading Rubric:
  * 1 point: All styling is in `landing.css` and applied with CSS selectors, 
    instead of inline
  * 1 point: Hero element with a call to action button or link

    "About Us", "Terms of Service", "Privacy", etc.

  * 1 point: Column-count changes to fewer columns on a narrow screen width 
    (<500px)
  * 1 point: Correct use of one flexbox layout
  * 1 point: Flex changes to one item per row on a narrow screen width
  * 1 point: Correct use of one grid layout
  * 1 point: Grid changes to fewer columns on a narrow screen width
