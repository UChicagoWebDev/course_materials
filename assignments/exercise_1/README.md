### Instructions
This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and CSS.  Some HTML/CSS 
research might be required. I recommend using the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
First, copy your `myname.html` document from class into this repository. 
Update it to include:
- Your name in the title bar
- an ordered list of your favorite foods
- an unordered list of your favorite movies or TV shows
- an 8x8 table of multiplication facts 1-8
- a link to a wikipedia article about a cute animal
If you wish, you may upload the new version back to uchicagowebdev.com
Second, modify `resume.html` so that it looks like [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).
Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact requirements.  
Note that the entire content of the page should be a width of 960px, and that 
the page should be centered on your screen.
HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS, as well as how the `margin`
property can be used to center an element on the screen.
ANOTHER HINT: You only need to add CSS code inside the `<style>...</style>` element.
No other changes should be necessary.
### Rubric
1 point for each of the following:
`yourname.html`
- Title
- Ordered list
- Unordered list
- Table
- Link
Resume
- Arial font applied to all text. Fall back to a system sans-serif font if Arial isn't installed

- Horizontal divider lines are 3px solid gray
- 960px content width, centered horizontally using `margin`
