# Syllabus for Web Development - Winter 2025

## Course Description
This course is intended to prepare students with a general programming background to work on teams producing modern web applications. Students will learn a strong foundation of core web technologies and protocols, an overview of the major design patterns in the history of web development, and a detailed introduction to the current industry standard. We will have an emphasis on learning from publicly-available documentation, so that students are equipped to learn new techniques and frameworks in this rapidly-evolving field.

Specifically, the course will cover content layout and styling with HTML and CSS, dynamically generating page content on the web server, interacting with databases, interacting with remote resources using HTTP and REST, client-side interactivity with modern Javascript, and the creation of single-page applications.
This course uses agile software techniques to build real, working software each week. We will work as closely as possible to how software is developed in industry, and all work is asynchronous, open-note and open-internet. Students make indivual submissions to assignments, but encouraged to discuss them amongst themselves.

We have a GitHub Organization for the course at https://github.com/UChicagoWebDev. I will be posting lecture notes and slaides there, at https://github.com/UChicagoWebDev/course_materials.

We have a Slack channel #web-development on the [UChicago CS Slack](https://cs-uchicago.slack.com) for the course that everyone should join and use. That's the best place to ask questions about course content, so that the whole class can benefit from the answers.

## Assignments and Grading
Students will be expected to complete small assignments in class, more substantial take home exercises due the next week before class, and a final project due by the end of finals week, March 14, 2025.

## Grading Policy
Because of our focus on writing working applications, this course can be a lot of work. But the material is accessible and the grading relatively generous. Grades are not curved in this class, and there is no reason every student could not receive an A. Instead they are based on the percentge of all possible points students have earned on their quizzes, exercises, and final projects:
- 90.0/93.0%: A-/A
- 80.0/83.0/87.0: B-/B/B+
- 70.0/73.0/77.0: C-/C/C+
- Below 70.0: Dealt with on a case-by-case basis

## Late Policy
In-class exercises and quizzes are due at 8:30 pm. Take-home exercises are due at 5:00pm on the day of the next class session. Work that is submitted after the deadline without an extension is subject to a 1 point penalty per day. **Start early**. Extensions must be granted before the deadline, and requests will be regarded more favorably the sooner they are made and the earlier your git history for the assignment begins.

## Extra Credit
1 point per course session of extra credit may be awarded at the instructor's discretion for significant contributions to in-class discussion.

## Collaboration and AI Policy
I **strongly** encourage students to collaborate on exercises together. Additionally, students may access any resources they find helpful, including online documentation, discussion boards, and generative AI models like ChatGPT or [PhoenixAI](https://phoenixai.uchicago.edu/). For maximum learning (and for consistency with the University's academic honesty policy), we have only two requirements:
1. You must type in your own code yourself and submit it separately. All grades are individual. You simply won't learn anywhere near as much by copy and pasting as you will by typing it out yourself.
1. Your submissions must list anyone you worked with and any sources you consulted (e.g. Stack OverflowLinks to an external site., ChatGPT) in their README.md files.

## Course Prerequisites
Students must be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably an object-oriented language. This course requires competency in Unix and Linux. Please plan to attend the MPCS Unix Bootcamp (https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/page/mpcs-unix-bootcamp) or take the online MPCS Unix Bootcamp Course on Canvas if you do not have familiarity working on the command line in *nix environments.
