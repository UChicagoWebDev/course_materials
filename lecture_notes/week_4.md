# Why We Javascript
> The basic advice regarding response times has been about the same for [fifty]
years
<footer><cite>Miller 1968; Card et al. 1991<cite></footer>

.big[**0.1 second**] is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is
**reacting instantaneously**, meaning that no special feedback is necessary
except to display the result.

.big[**1.0 second**] is about the limit for the **user's flow of thought** to stay
uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special
feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second,
but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.

.big[**10 seconds**] is about the limit for **keeping the user's attention** focused
on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while
waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given feedback indicating
when the computer expects to be done. Feedback during the delay is especially
important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will
then not know what to expect.

# Why We Javascript
###It is very hard to get HTTP responses back in less than 100 ms.
So if you're doing everything right, you get 1 request that you can send out and
back without interrupting the user's flow. And if you have to reload the whole
page, with all its HTML, CSS, and images, forget about it. You'll easily be
spending hundreds or thousands of milliseconds.

# Why We Javascript
> Netscape quickly realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Even if
you simply wanted to check that users entered correct values in a form, you
needed to send the data to the server in order to give feedback.
