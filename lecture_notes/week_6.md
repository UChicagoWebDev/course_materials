# Single Page Applications (SPAs)
> A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts
> with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from
> the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire
> new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like
> a native app.
>
> In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML,
> JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page
> load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the
> page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

# Static Assets in Flask
### From Exercise 5

# Path

# Path, Routing, and History
Look at our example application in `mpa`: 
https://github.com/UChicagoWebDev/course_materials/tree/main/examples/week_6/mpa
## We have modified it to simulate it being very slow to load:

# Path, Routing, and History
`spa` only loads once, then switches between animals instantly with javascript.
But what if we want to be able to link to `/cat`? What if we want `/bear` in our
browser history?
Modify the example app in `spa/` so that the animal we pick as best goes into
our browser history. Make sure that if we load the page with that URL, the
correct animal is identified as best.

# Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of information left on a visitor's computer by a website, via a web browser.
Cookies are used to personalize a user's web experience with a website. It may contain the user's preferences or inputs when accessing that website. A user can customize their web browser to accept, reject, or delete cookies.
Cookies can be set and modified at the server level using the Set-Cookie HTTP header, or with JavaScript using document.cookie.

# SessionStorage and LocalStorage
`sessionStorage` maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).
- Stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.
- Data is never transferred to the server.
- Storage limit is larger than a cookie (at most 5MB).
`localStorage` does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.
- Stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data.
- Storage limit is the maximum amongst the two.
